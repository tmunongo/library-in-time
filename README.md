# Repo for tutorial

I took `lifetimes` in Rust a bit too literally.

In this one, we explore Rust lifetimes and traits by building a Time Traveller's Library.
Book exist in a given timeline, and can only be borrowed from the library while they exist.

There's also so much potential to extend the metaphor with time travelling and time-constrained readers.

```shell
git clone github.com/tmunongo/library-in-time
